oh-image is written in TypeScript, so you get full type safety and autocomplete out of the box.

## Import type definitions

When you import an image with the `?oh` query parameter, TypeScript needs to understand what type that import returns. Without proper configuration, you'll see an error like:

```
Cannot find module './image.jpg?oh' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

There are two ways to fix this:

### Option 1: Using `vite-env.d.ts` (recommended)

If your project has a `vite-env.d.ts` file (created by Vite's scaffolding), add a triple-slash reference:

```ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
/// <reference types="@lonik/oh-image/client" />
```

### Option 2: Using the `types` array in tsconfig.json

Add `@lonik/oh-image/client` to the `types` array in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vite/client", "@lonik/oh-image/client"]
  }
}
```

**Note:** When you specify a `types` array, TypeScript only includes the types you list. Make sure to include other type definitions your project needs (like `vite/client`).
