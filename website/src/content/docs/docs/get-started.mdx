import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

## Installation

Start by installing the package and the `sharp` image processing library using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@lonik/oh-image sharp" />

## Setup

To enable automatic image optimization, placeholders, and metadata generation, add the `ohImage` plugin to your Vite configuration.

Open `vite.config.js` (or `vite.config.ts`) and add the plugin:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { ohImage } from "@lonik/oh-image/plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [ohImage(), react()],
});
```

### How it Works

For the plugin to process your images, you must import the asset as a module and append the `?oh` suffix to the import path. The plugin automatically converts your images to optimized formats (like WebP/AVIF), generates responsive `srcSet` variants, and creates a low-quality placeholder for lazy loading—all out of the box.

```jsx
// Proper import with the 'oh' suffix
import hero from "./hero.png?oh";

// Pass the imported object to the src prop
<Image src={hero} alt="hero image" />;
```

:::note
**Asset Location:** Images **must** reside inside your `src` directory (e.g., in an `assets` folder) to be processed. Files in the `public` folder are copied as-is by Vite and **will not** be optimized by this plugin.

**Module Imports:** Importing an image with the `?oh` suffix returns a structured object containing the optimization data, not just a string path.

## Loaders

Image CDNs are essential for modern web performance. `oh-image` features built-in functionality to serve images via CDN both easily and optimally.

The `Image` component accepts a `loader` prop. When provided, this function automatically generates image URLs based on specific parameters like width, height, and format.

### Example: Cloudinary Integration

If you are using Cloudinary, you can set up a loader like this:

```jsx
const loader = useCloudinary({
  path: "https://res.cloudinary.com/example",
});

<Image loader={loader} src="hero.png" width={600} height={1200} />;
```

The loader will automatically generate the `src` attribute, resulting in a URL similar to:
`https://res.cloudinary.com/example/image/upload/f_auto,w_600,h_1200/hero.png`

The `Image` component also uses the loader to generate all `srcSet` variants and the low-resolution placeholder.
