import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

## Installation

Install the necessary packages using your preferred package manager:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@lonik/oh-image sharp" />

Now, you can use the `Image` component directly in your React application:

```jsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";
...
<Image asap src="hero.png" alt="hero image" />;
```

---

## Vite Plugin Integration

`oh-image` includes a Vite plugin that automatically optimizes static images. To get started, add the `ohImage` plugin to your `plugins` array in `vite.config.js`.

```ts
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { ohImage } from "@lonik/oh-image/plugin"

export default defineConfig({
    ...
  plugins: [ohImage(), react()],
  ...
});
```

### How it Works

For the plugin to process your images, you must import the asset as a module and append the `?oh` suffix to the import path:

```jsx
// Proper import with the 'oh' suffix
import hero from "./hero.png?oh";

// Pass the imported object to the src prop
<Image src={hero} alt="hero image" />;
```

### Important Considerations

- **Module Imports:** Notice that the image is passed as an **object**, not a string. This allows the Vite plugin to intercept and process the file.
- **Asset Location:** Images must reside **outside** of the `public` folder. Vite does not process files in `public` (it simply copies them to the `dist` folder), so the `ohImage` plugin will skip them. It is recommended to store your images in an `assets` folder.
- **Automated Features:** Beyond standard optimization, the plugin automatically generates various `srcSet` variants and a placeholder image.

## Loaders

Image CDNs are essential for modern web performance. `oh-image` features built-in functionality to serve images via CDN both easily and optimally.

The `Image` component accepts a `loader` prop. When provided, this function automatically generates image URLs based on specific parameters like width, height, and format.

### Example: Cloudinary Integration

If you are using Cloudinary, you can set up a loader like this:

```jsx
const loader = useCloudinary({
  path: "https://res.cloudinary.com/example",
});

<Image loader={loader} src="hero.png" width={600} height={1200} />;
```

The loader will automatically generate the `src` attribute, resulting in a URL similar to:
`https://res.cloudinary.com/example/image/upload/f_auto,w_600,h_1200/hero.png`

The `Image` component also uses the loader to generate all `srcSet` variants and the low-resolution placeholder.

### Global Configuration

- **Default Options:** Loaders can be configured globally to use default settings when using loader hooks.
- **Default Loaders:** You can configure the `Image` component to use a specific loader by default, removing the need to pass the `loader` prop to every instance.

### Supported CDNs

We provide built-in loaders for popular services, with more being added regularly:

- **Cloudinary**
- **Cloudflare**
- **imgproxy**

If you use a different service, you can easily [create a custom loader](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23).
