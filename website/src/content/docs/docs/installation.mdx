description: How to install oh-image in your project

import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

Install oh-image with your favorite package manager:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@lonik/oh-image sharp" />

oh-image requires **React 18** or later. It also relies on [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/), a high-performance image processing library, for optimization under the hood.
