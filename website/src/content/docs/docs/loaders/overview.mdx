Loaders are functions that generate image URLs. They are essential when you want to serve images from an external Image CDN (like Cloudinary, Imgproxy, or Cloudflare) instead of hosting them locally.

## What is a Loader?

A loader is simply a function that takes a configuration object (src, width, etc.) and returns a string URL.

The `Image` component uses this function to generate the correct URL for each image size in the `srcSet`.

```ts
type ImageLoader = (options: ImageLoaderOptions) => string;

interface ImageLoaderOptions {
  src: string;
  width?: number | null | undefined;
  height?: number | null | undefined;
  isPlaceholder?: boolean;
}
```

## Integration with Image Component

You can pass a `loader` directly to any `Image` component. When a loader is present, the component will use it to construct URLs for the `src` and every entry in the `srcSet`.

```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";

const myCustomLoader = ({ src, width }) => {
  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}`;
}

export function App() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="my-image.jpg"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      loader={myCustomLoader}
    />
  );
}
```

## Global Configuration

Setting a loader on every single image component is tedious. Instead, you can configure a loader globally using the `ImageProvider`. This is the recommended approach for most applications.

Wrap your app (or a part of it) with `ImageProvider` and pass your desired loader. All child `Image` components will automatically use this loader.

```tsx
import { ImageProvider } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";
import { cloudinaryLoader } from "@lonik/oh-image/loaders";

export function App() {
  return (
    <ImageProvider loader={cloudinaryLoader}>
      {/* All images inside here will use the Cloudinary loader */}
      <MyPage />
    </ImageProvider>
  );
}
```

## Built-in Loaders

`oh-image` comes with several built-in loaders for popular image services. We are regularly adding more.

-   [**Cloudflare Images**](/docs/loaders/cloudflare)
-   [**Cloudinary**](/docs/loaders/cloudinary)
-   [**Imgproxy**](/docs/loaders/imgproxy)

## Custom Loaders

If you don't find a loader for your specific use case, check out the [Custom Loader](/docs/loaders/custom-loader) documentation.
