<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is a comprehensive solution for handling images in React applications. It combines a powerful runtime component with a build-time optimizer to cover all your image needs.

The library consists of two main parts that work together or independently:

### 1. The Image Component
A smart React component that serves as a drop-in replacement for the standard `<img>` tag. It handles:
- **Dynamic Optimization:** Works with external image CDNs (Cloudinary, Cloudflare, Imgproxy) via "loaders".
- **Performance Best Practices:** Enforces correct usage of `loading`, `fetchPriority`, and decoding strategies.
- **Responsiveness:** Automatically calculates `srcSet` and `sizes` to ensure the best image is served for every device.
- **Developer Experience:** Provides typed props and useful assertions to prevent common performance pitfalls.

### 2. The Vite Plugin (Static Images)
A build tool that processes your local assets. When you import an image with the `?oh` suffix, the plugin:
- **Transforms & Optimizes:** Converts images to modern formats (WebP, AVIF) and resizes them at build time.
- **Generates Metadata:** Automatically creates the `srcSet`, width, height, and a blurred placeholder.
- **Zero Config:** The generated metadata is passed directly to the `Image` component, so you don't have to manually configure dimensions or responsive variants.

## Key Features

- **Automatic `srcSet` Generation:** Whether static or dynamic, your images will always have the correct responsive variants.
- **Smart Defaults:** Sensible default `sizes` attributes for various aspect ratios.
- **Priority Loading:** A single `priority` prop to optimize Critical Image (LCP) loading (e.g., hero images).
- **Lazy Loading Placeholders:** Built-in support for low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) to prevent layout shifts.
- **CDN Integrations:** First-class support for `imgproxy`, `cloudflare`, and `cloudinary`, plus a custom loader API.
- **Global Configuration:** Set defaults for loaders, breakpoints, and behavior globally via `ImageProvider`.

You can think of Oh-Image as the Next.js `<Image />` component, but built specifically for the Vite ecosystem.

## Why?

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
