<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is an image optimization library for the Vite ecosystem. It combines a powerful React component with a Vite plugin to deliver responsive, fast-loading images with minimal configuration. Think of it as the Next.js Image component, but designed specifically for Vite-based projects.

Images are one of the largest contributors to page weight and slow load times. Oh Image solves this by automatically generating optimized image formats, creating responsive srcsets for different screen sizes, and providing blur-up placeholders for a smooth loading experience. All of this happens at build time, so your users get the fastest possible experience.

Getting started is simple — install the package, add the plugin to your Vite config, and start using the `Image` component. The library handles format conversion, responsive breakpoints, and lazy loading out of the box, while still giving you full control when you need it.
