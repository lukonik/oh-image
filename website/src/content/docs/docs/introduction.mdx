<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is your all-in-one solution for handling images in React. Whether you're dealing with local assets or remote URLs, we've got you covered with a powerful runtime component and a smart build-time optimizer.

Here is what you need to know:

### The Image Component
Think of this as `<img>` on steroids. It is a smart React component that replaces the standard HTML tag and handles all the heavy lifting for you. It connects easily with image CDNs like Cloudinary or Cloudflare, and automatically handles performance best practices like lazy loading, fetch priority, and decoding. Plus, it generates the right `srcSet` and `sizes` so your users always get the best image for their device.

**Example:**
```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";

<Image 
  src="https://example.com/photo.jpg" 
  width={800} 
  height={600} 
  alt="Remote photo" 
/>
```

### The Static Image Component
This is where the magic happens for your local files. Our Vite plugin lets you import images directly as React components. When you add `?oh` to your import, we transform the image to modern formats like WebP or AVIF and generate multiple sizes for perfect responsiveness. It even creates a blurred background placeholder for that instant loading feel, giving you a zero-config component ready to drop into your JSX.

**Example:**
```tsx
// Import with ?oh to get a component
import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg?oh";

<HeroImage alt="My hero image" className="w-full" />
```

## Why?

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
