<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is an Image component 
library that is used for React and Vite apps. It ships with tiny but powerful Image component and Vite optimizer plugin
that automatically optimizes Static images on the website. Depending on the status of your image if it is static or fetched remotely
from the CDN provider, you would use one of the two. Let me give you quick examples so you get taste of the project

## Vite plugin
vite plugin main purpose is to generate Image component automatically for you based on static images. So let's say you want
to load hero image on the homepage from the assets folder:

```tsx
  import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg"; // this will return image url

  function App(){
    return <img src={HeroImage} />
  }

```
now in this case the src value will be simple url for the image and you have tu manually do lot's of the things to make this 
image responsive and optimized. Now let's try the vite plugin version, all we have to do is add query param`$oh` suffix to the import
and oh-image vite plugin will take care of the rest.


Here is what you need to know:

### The Image Component
Think of this as `<img>` on steroids. It is a smart React component that replaces the standard HTML tag and handles all the heavy lifting for you. It connects easily with image CDNs like Cloudinary or Cloudflare, and automatically handles performance best practices like lazy loading, fetch priority, and decoding. Plus, it generates the right `srcSet` and `sizes` so your users always get the best image for their device.

**Example:**
```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";

<Image 
  src="https://example.com/photo.jpg" 
  width={800} 
  height={600} 
  alt="Remote photo" 
/>
```

### The Static Image Component
This is where the magic happens for your local files. Our Vite plugin lets you import images directly as React components. When you add `?oh` to your import, we transform the image to modern formats like WebP or AVIF and generate multiple sizes for perfect responsiveness. It even creates a blurred background placeholder for that instant loading feel, giving you a zero-config component ready to drop into your JSX.

**Example:**
```tsx
// Import with ?oh to get a component
import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg?oh";

<HeroImage alt="My hero image" className="w-full" />
```

## Why?

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
