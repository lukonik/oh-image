<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is a tiny but powerful
image component for React. It is highly optimized and includes all the features
you would need for production-grade applications. The feature list includes:

- Automatically generating `srcSets`.
- Using sensible defaults for `sizes` attributes for different aspect ratios.
- Proper assertions to prevent you from using performance-killing attributes together, such as `loading="lazy"` with `fetchingpriority="high"`.
- A single attribute, `"asap"`, that configures images (like headlines) to load them as soon as possible.
- A custom Vite plugin that automatically transforms images, generating `srcSets` versions on-the-fly in Dev mode and generating them as static assets during build-time.
- Different loaders that will fetch images from your favorite CDN:
  - `imgproxy`
  - `cloudflare`
  - `cloudinary`
  - A custom loader for your specific CDN.
  - More CDNs to come...
- Adding an optimized placeholder image while the main image is loading.
- Global and local configuration for every piece of functionality.

You can think of Oh-Image as a Next.js image component, but without Next.js.

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
