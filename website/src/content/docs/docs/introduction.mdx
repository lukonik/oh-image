<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is an Image component
library that is used for React and Vite apps. It ships with tiny but powerful
Image component and Vite optimizer plugin that automatically optimizes Static
images on the website. Depending on the status of your image if it is static or
fetched remotely from the CDN provider, you would use one of the two. Let me
give you quick examples so you get taste of the project

## Vite plugin

vite plugin main purpose is to generate Image component automatically for you based on static images. So let's say you want
to load hero image on the homepage from the assets folder:

```tsx
import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg"; // this will return image url

function App() {
  return <img src={HeroImage} />;
}
```

now in this case the src value will be simple url for the image and you have tu manually do lot's of the things to make this
image responsive and optimized. Now let's try the vite plugin version, all we have to do is add query param`$oh` suffix to the import
and oh-image vite plugin will take care of the rest.

```tsx
import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg?$oh"; // this will return Image component

function App() {
  return <HeroImage />;
}
```

now this will return the Image component where the inner img element will look something like this:

```HTML
<img class="flex" width="1920" height="1280"  loading="lazy" fetchpriority="auto"
srcset="/@oh-images/breakpoint-16-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 16w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-48-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 48w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-96-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 96w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-128-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 128w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-384-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 384w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-640-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 640w,
\/@oh-images/breakpoint-750-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 750w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-828-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 828w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-1080-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 1080w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-1200-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 1200w,
/@oh-images/breakpoint-1920-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp 1920w"
src="/@oh-images/main-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp"
style="background-position: 50% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-image: url(&quot;/@oh-images/placeholder-deab89be27aab77b-d9c45d4b5795047a-hero.webp&quot;);
background-size: cover;"
sizes="auto, 100vw"
>
```

Long html but it worth exploring so automatically we got:

- width taken from image metadata
- height taken from image metadata
- srcset images for wide range of devices
- placeholder image in the background while image loads
- all images are optimized to the webp although the image was in jpg
- sensible default attributes to increase the performance of your website
  & sizes set by using best possible values according to srcSets and other attributes

having all these with a single suffix is not a bad thing.
as we know hero images must be loaded as soon as possible. for oh-image it is just setting single attribute to true

```tsx
function App() {
  return <HeroImage priority />;
}
```

and done img will be configured the way to load the image as soon as possible

This version is perfect for images that needs to be loaded statically and is configured for you. But what to do when you want
to fetch the image from Image CDN or you don't want any optimization and just render img from public dir. That's when Image component comes into play

## Image component

Image component is a React component returned by vite optimizer plugin and can be used as a standalone component. it has bunch of properties
to make img responsive and fast.
example:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="some-image.jpg"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      breakpoints={[16, 32, 64, 128]}
    />
  );
}
```

more on this properties later in the guide. Using this Image in such away won't optimize static image but it still ar capable of lot's of things
for exmaple automatically generating srcSets, set sensible performant defaults etc.

But mostly it shines when it is used with conjuction with Loaders

## Loaders

Loaders are the bridge between Image component and Image CDN provider.
it gives you out-of-the box integration with popular Image CDN providers
all we have to do is pass specific CDN loader to the image loader prop and that it is. Let's say you use Cloudinary Image CDN provider.
there is a separate loader for this Cloudinary and use it like this:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";
import { useCloudinaryLoader } from "@lonik/oh-image/cloudinary";

function App() {
  const loader = useCloudinaryLoader({
    transform: {
      rotate: 180,
    },
  });

  return (
    <Image
      width={600}
      height={400}
      placeholder
      breakpoints={[16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]}
      loader={loader}
      src="car.jpg"
    />
  );
}
```

the image component will create all the necessary attributes out of the box and use the loader
to generate proper url for proper CDN. in addition to the main src url it will also generate
srcSet urls based on the loader and placeholderUrl for example the
src attribute url will looke like
`https://res.cloudinary.com/example/image/upload/w_600,h_400,f_webp,r_180/car.jpg`
and it will return image with rotated 180 deg

Currently we support three providers I know it's not a lot, but many will come more really soon. Also custom loader is simple as creating
a function that accepts some options and return string url

I hope you get the idea about the library. in next guides we will explore more in depth

## Why?

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
