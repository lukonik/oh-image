<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is an Image component 
library that is used for React and Vite apps. It ships with tiny but powerful Image component and Vite optimizer plugin
that automatically optimizes Static images on the website. Depending on the status of your image if it is static or fetched remotely
from the CDN provider, you would use one of the two. Let me give you quick examples so you get taste of the project

## Vite plugin
vite plugin main purpose is to generate Image component automatically for you based on static images. So let's say you want
to load hero image on the homepage from the assets folder:

```tsx
  import HeroImage from "./assets/hero.jpg"; // this will return image url

  function App(){
    return <img src={HeroImage} />
  }

```
now in this case the src value will be simple url for the image and you have tu manually do lot's of the things to make this 
image responsive and optimized. Now let's try the vite plugin version, all we have to do is add query param`$oh` suffix to the import
and oh-image vite plugin will take care of the rest.


- Automatically generating `srcSets`.
- Using sensible defaults for `sizes` attributes for different aspect ratios.
- Proper assertions to prevent you from using performance-killing attributes together, such as `loading="lazy"` with `fetchingpriority="high"`.
- A single attribute, `"priority"`, that configures images (like headlines) to load them as soon as possible.
- A custom Vite plugin that automatically transforms images, generating `srcSets` versions on-the-fly in Dev mode and generating them as static assets during build-time.
- Different loaders that will fetch images from your favorite CDN:
  - `imgproxy`
  - `cloudflare`
  - `cloudinary`
  - A custom loader for your specific CDN.
  - More CDNs to come...
- Adding an optimized placeholder image while the main image is loading.
- Global and local configuration for every piece of functionality.

You can think of Oh-Image as a Next.js image component, but without Next.js.

## Why?

If you are used to creating `<img>` tags with only `src` and `alt` attributes,
you might question why you should use this library. Although you will still get benefits even with such small requirements
(like automatically generating optimized images for you or easily fetching them from your favorite CDN),
the real power comes when you understand how images work on the web. I strongly recommend you read [Web.dev Images](https://web.dev/learn/images)—it is an
excellent guide you can read in your free time, and it will give you the knowledge and confidence to use this library instead of a simple `<img>` tag
that needs to perform optimally across all different devices
