<span className="project-title pr-1">Oh Image</span> is an image component
library that consists of two parts:
<br /> A React image component that gives you power on top of the img element to
have responsive, fast, and optimized images with sensible defaults. <br />
A Vite plugin that handles image optimization automatically.
<br />
Think of it as the Next.js Image component, but for the Vite ecosystem.

## Installation

Install the package with your favorite package manager:

<PackageManagers type="add" pkg="@lonik/oh-image sharp" />

The library depends on [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) — a high-performance image optimization library.

## Usage

To use the library, import the oh-image plugin into your Vite config:

```ts
import { ohImage } from "@lonik/oh-image/plugin";
...
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [ohImage()],
})
```

Now, to optimize an image, add the `?oh` suffix to the image import:

```ts
// ?oh tells the plugin to optimize this image
import carImage from "./assets/car.png?oh";
```

:::note
To optimize images, they must not be in the public directory. 
Vite doesn't process the public directory — it simply copies files as-is — 
so the oh-image plugin will skip processing even if `?oh` is in the suffix. 
You can place your images anywhere else; we recommend using an assets directory.

Example:

```ts
// This won't work because the image is served from public
import carImage from "/car.png?oh";

// This will work as expected
import car2Image from "./assets/car.png?oh";

// This will also work, including nested folders
import car3Image from "./car.png?oh";
```

:::

As a final step, use the `Image` component to render the optimized image:

```tsx
import { Image } from "@lonik/oh-image/react";
import carImage from "./car.png?oh";

function App() {
  return <Image src={carImage} placeholder />;
}
```

This renders an image component with sensible defaults, fully preconfigured srcSets for different breakpoints, and a placeholder image that displays quickly until the full image loads.
